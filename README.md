# Cookbook Text Mining

A personal project to use text mining in R to analyse and compare several cookbooks.

See the [TextMiningCookingBooks](TextMiningCookingBooks.md) file for the code and intermediate steps in the analysis process.

The final data visual is made with R + Illustrator. 

The code is not very "clean" - this is my learning process and always a work in progress.
